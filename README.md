Searching for symmetries in ODEs and PDEs using Python.

# Status

still playing around with Janet bases

# Goals: 

* Short term:
    * Play around and make some parts work (at least for the Q[x,y,z] domain), ready for a small 0.0.1 release
* Mid term:
    * Make it a valuable package
* Long term:
    * Maybe integration into SciPy|SymPy|SageMath
